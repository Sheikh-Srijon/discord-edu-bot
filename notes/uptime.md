To ensure high uptime for your Discord bot and manage API timeouts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Use a Reliable Hosting Solution

- **AWS EC2**: Continue using EC2 but ensure it's properly configured for stability.
- **Elastic Beanstalk or ECS**: Consider using AWS Elastic Beanstalk or ECS for better scalability and management.
- **Other Providers**: Explore other cloud providers like Google Cloud or Azure for potentially better pricing or features.

### 2. Implement a Process Manager

- **PM2**: Use a process manager like PM2 to keep your bot running. It can automatically restart your bot if it crashes.
  ```bash
  npm install pm2 -g
  pm2 start bot.py --interpreter=python3
  ```

### 3. Use a Keep-Alive Service

- **Uptime Robot**: Use a service like Uptime Robot to ping your bot periodically, keeping it active and alerting you to downtime.

### 4. Optimize API Calls

- **Rate Limiting**: Ensure your bot handles rate limits gracefully by implementing exponential backoff or retry logic.
- **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling to manage API requests efficiently.

### 5. Monitor and Log

- **CloudWatch**: Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor your instance's performance and set up alerts for any issues.
- **Logging**: Implement logging in your bot to track errors and performance issues.

### 6. Handle API Timeouts

- **Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic for API calls to Perplexity, with exponential backoff to handle temporary timeouts.
- **Timeout Settings**: Adjust timeout settings in your HTTP requests to Perplexity to ensure they are reasonable.

### 7. Regular Backups and Updates

- **Backup**: Regularly back up your bot's data and configuration.
- **Updates**: Keep your bot and its dependencies updated to benefit from performance improvements and security patches.

By implementing these strategies, you can improve the uptime and reliability of your Discord bot while effectively managing API timeouts.
